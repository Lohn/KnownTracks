## Uses
* [leaflet-gpx](https://github.com/mpetazzoni/leaflet-gpx) :  This plugin, based on the work of [Pavel Shramov](http://github.com/shramov) and his
[leaflet-plugins](http://github.com/shramov/leaflet-plugins), it allows for the analysis and parsing of a GPX track in order to display it as a Leaflet map
layer. As it parses the GPX data, it will record information about the recorded track, including total time, moving time, total distance, elevation stats and
heart-rate.
